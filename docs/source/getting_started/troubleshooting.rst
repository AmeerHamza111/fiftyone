This page lists common issues encountered when installing FiftyOne and possible
solutions. If you encounter an issue that this page doesn't help you resolve,
feel free to

Python/pip incompatibilities
----------------------------

"No matching distribution found"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you attempt to install FiftyOne with a version of Python or pip that is too
old, you may encounter errors like these:

.. code-block:: text

    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement fiftyone (from versions: none)
    ERROR: No matching distribution found for fiftyone

.. code-block:: text

    Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement fiftyone-brain (from versions: )
    No matching distribution found for fiftyone-brain

.. code-block:: text

    fiftyone requires Python '>=3.5' but the running Python is 3.4.10

To resolve this, you will need to use Python 3.5 or newer, and pip 19.3 or
newer. See the :ref:`installation guide <installing-fiftyone>` for details. If
you have installed a suitable version of Python in a virtual environment and
still encounter this error, ensure that the virtual environment is activated.
See the
:doc:`virtual environment setup guide <virtualenv>` for more details.

"No module named skbuild"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Linux, this error can occur when attempting to install OpenCV with an old pip
version. To fix this, upgrade pip. See the
:ref:`installation guide <installing-fiftyone>` for instructions, or the
`opencv-python FAQ <https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/>`_ for more
details.

IPython installation
--------------------

If you are using IPython and a virtual environment for FiftyOne, IPython must
be installed in the virtual environment, per the
:ref:`installation guide <installing-extras>`. If you attempt to use a
system-wide IPython installation in a virtual environment with FiftyOne, you
may encounter errors such as:

.. code-block:: text

    .../IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:935: UserWarning: Attempting to work in a virtualenv. If you encounter problems, please install IPython inside the virtualenv.

.. code-block:: text

    File ".../fiftyone/core/../_service_main.py", line 29, in <module>
        import psutil
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psutil'

.. code-block:: text

    ServerSelectionTimeoutError: localhost:27017: [Errno 111] Connection refused

To resolve this, install IPython in your active virtual environment (see the
:ref:`virtual environment guide <virtualenv-guide>` for more information):

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install ipython

MongoDB compatibility issues on Linux
-------------------------------------

The ``fiftyone-db`` package includes a build of MongoDB that works on Ubuntu
18.04 and several other modern distributions. If this build does not work on
your distribution, you may encounter an error similar to:

.. code-block:: text

    /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/fiftyone/db/bin/mongod: failed to launch:
    /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/fiftyone/db/bin/mongod: error while loading shared libraries:
    libcrypto.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

.. code-block:: text

    RuntimeError: Could not find mongod >= 3.6

To resolve this, you can install an alternative package on some distributions,
detailed below, or install a compatible version of MongoDB system-wide.

Alternative builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternative builds of MongoDB are available as pip packages for the
distributions listed below, and can be installed by running the corresponding
command. Note that these packages must be installed *after* the `fiftyone`
package; if you install `fiftyone` afterwards, you can fix your MongoDB
installation by adding `--force-reinstall` to the commands below.

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Ubuntu 16.04

    .. code-block:: shell

      pip install --index https://pypi.voxel51.com fiftyone-db-ubuntu1604

  .. tab:: Debian 9

    .. code-block:: shell

      pip install --index https://pypi.voxel51.com fiftyone-db-debian9

Manual installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FiftyOne also supports using an existing MongoDB installation (version 3.6 or
newer). This can be installed through many distributions' package managers.
Note that only the `mongod` (server) binary is required, so you may not need
the complete MongoDB package. For example, Debian-based distributions make this
available in the `mongodb-server` package.

If your distribution does not provide a new-enough version of MongoDB, or if
you would like to install a newer version, see
`the MongoDB documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/>`_
for instructions on installing MongoDB on your distribution. Note that you only
need the `mongodb-org-server` package in this case.

To verify the version of your MongoDB installation, run `mongod --version`,
which should produce output that looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

   db version v4.2.6
   git version: 20364840b8f1af16917e4c23c1b5f5efd8b352f8
   OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.1  11 Sep 2018
   allocator: tcmalloc
   modules: none
   build environment:
       distmod: ubuntu1804
       distarch: x86_64
       target_arch: x86_64

Verify that the version after "db version" is at least 3.6.
